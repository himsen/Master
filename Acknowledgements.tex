I would like to use this opportunity to thank my two supervisors. First, Claudio Orlandi for his guidance, many fruitful discussions and a lot of fun. His patience and knowledge has been indispensable. Second, also many thanks to Johan P. Hansen who stepped in as formal supervisor even though the topic of this thesis is not his speciality. 

I am in debt to Anders and Elpiniki who both proofread a draft of this thesis with $\epsilon$-notice. They managed to cryptographically hide my many silly grammar mistakes.
